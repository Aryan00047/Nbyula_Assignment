TASK 1 - TEST PLANNING


1.All the links on the website should lead to their respective pages.
2.All the api calls made should not be openly visible to the user or else any hacker can use it for their personal benefit.
3.Images used on the website should be well optimised and compressed so as to reduce loading time.
4.Data should be managed at the backend so that while changing the data, frontend doesn’t get hampered.
5.Negative test cases should be checked.
Eg: User clicking randomly on screen 
Internet connection getting lost while the transaction is going on.
User takes to long to complete the transaction.
User tries to do transaction simultaneously on 2 different devices.
6.Cross browser and cross platform testing should be done to minimise chances of breaking UI.
eg: android, ios, windows, mac
browsers: Safari,Chrome,Firefox
7.All the filters and sorting options should be verified and manual reloading the page should not hamper them.
All these test cases should be on priority
